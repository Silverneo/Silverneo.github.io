Today I would like to talk about an interesting thing called Recursive Acronym - an acronym which refers to itself recursively. I first found this interesting name phenomenon when I was googling the meaning of GNU, which stands for GNU's Not Unix. I was quite surprised that we can use acronym in such a way. However, If we look at the full name, it does explain the term GNU in a smart manner. Some other Recursive Acronyms I know are listed below.

- PHP - PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor
- PIP - PIP Installs Packages
- RPM - RPM Package Manager
- YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language
- WINE - WINE Is Not an Emulator

More examples can be found from the wikipedia page of [Recursive acronym](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym).
