I recently received two-year micro plan from GitHub for free! I am here to share how I get the discount and spread the news to you.

I started to use GitHub this summer and I found it is really a good place to learn and practice. This semester I joined a course called Web Application Design which has a small design project. I would like to host the project on GitHub so that I can develop the project in a more productive way.

However, as a basic user, I can only own public folders which others can see without restrictions. To own private folders we need to pay every month. Although I like open source, I think this might not be suitable for our course project. So I googled and finally ended up with this website - [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/).

I followed the instructions to request a discount, filled in my university Email address and got the reply in just a minute. I got two-year Micro plan for free! It means I can own 5 private folders with unlimited collaborators! I just cannot believe it!

Hopefully I am not the last one to know it, now I would like to share this news to all of you so that you can enjoy this discount. GitHub is really a wonderful place to learn and contribute. Happy Forking!
